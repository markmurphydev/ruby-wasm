Points: 4

There exists a (semi-?) official Ruby spec, in the form of executable tests written in Ruby.
The tests are meant to be run within the implementation under test, so we'll probably have to wait on implementing tests using this.
Even so, it should be good to understand specific expected behaviors.
- Document the spec
	- Which implementations follow it or try to?
- Research the spec's implementation
	- What's does it require of the runtime to run the tests?
