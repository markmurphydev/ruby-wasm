- Opinions on codegen:
	- Keep maintaining big lexer definition, use refactoring and editor macros as much as possible
	- Multiple small macro-rules macros
		- Less-readable code
		- Slightly-more-readable individual macro definitions
	- Big declarative procedural-macro
		- Like the one in `main.rs`, from the command-line-parsing library
		- More-readable (but more-magic) code
		- Unreadable proc macros
