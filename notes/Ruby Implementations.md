# CRuby
The "real" ruby interpreter

Ruby spec suite:
https://github.com/ruby/spec
- There's an ISO spec but a reddit comment told me everyone uses this instead...
- I remember reading about some conflict over this, but it's in the Ruby github now,
  so maybe its resolved?
- It's executable! Nice for testing but I'd prefer some 

Attempt at a comprehensive circa ruby 2.7:

# mruby

- Made by the same guy as CRuby
> mruby is the lightweight implementation of the [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) complying to (part of) the [ISO standard](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579). mruby can be linked and embedded within your application. We provide the interpreter program "mruby" and the interactive mruby shell "mirb" as examples. You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby compiler "mrbc". All those tools reside in the "bin" directory. "mrbc" is also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file, see the "mrbtest" program under the "test" directory for an example.
- I don't know yet, but this might be more comprehensible than the CRuby source
