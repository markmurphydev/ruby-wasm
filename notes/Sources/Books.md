# Crafting Interpreters:
https://craftinginterpreters.com
- My old friend. Very good for an example of concrete implementation of bytecode interpreter.
- Gets a little lost in the weeds sometimes I think.

# Sebesta Concepts of Programming Languages
- Worth a re-read. There's chapters we didn't get to in class, too

# Engineering a compiler
http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/compilers/writing/Keith_Cooper_Linda_Torczon-Engineering_a_Compiler-EN.pdf
- I haven't read this yet, but I've seen it recommended, and it seems pretty useful.

# Types and programming languages
https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/
- There's one book people reccommend for formal semantics. Wasm docs link to it somewhere. Is it this one? I think.

The (8-person!) JP translation team talks for an hour about translating this book:
