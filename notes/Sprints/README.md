- [[Backlog]] contains an ordered list of PBIs, which link to individual PBI pages in the `./Backlog items` folder.
  PBI pages list an associated point value.
- When a PBI is completed, it's moved to [[Backlog#Completed]], and it's PBI page is moved to `./PBIs/Completed`
- Individual sprints have `Week X` files, with an ordered list of tasks.
	- Each task listing links to its backlog item
	- Completed tasks are moved to the `# Completed` heading in that sprint's file.

# Differences from Scrum
- Not all PBIs are user-facing.
	- "Research" items include an implicit documentation step, which is arguably user-facing?
	- I'll be careful to have enough user-facing changes in each sprint
- I'm going to add PBIs/tasks mid-week if relevant
	- That restriction exists to stop the boss from burning out employees, yes?
