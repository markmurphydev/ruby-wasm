# Completed
* [[Install, run, document Hoot Scheme compiler]]
  4pt
- [x] Get Linux VPS
- [x] Install Guix
- [ ] Try to build 0.1.0 release
- [ ] If that fails, try to build most recent release
- [x] If that fails, give up. It's not strictly necessary.
	- [ ] Compile some simple Scheme programs
	- [ ] Document enough Guile usage info to load and run the Hoot modules
Whatever, I quit. I can't believe I can't manage to build this, but.
I can still read the Hoot source.

- [[Walking skeleton ー end-to-end .wasm generation]]
	4pt
	- [x] Write a few AST nodes – program, statement, nil, ...
	- [x] Write types for Wasm data structures (module, function, ...)
	- [x] Serialize those types to `.wat` 
	- [x] Choose external `.wat -> .wasm` conversion tool
		- `wasm-tools`
	- [x] Document `.wat -> .wasm` conversion workflow
		- We use the `wat` library from `wasm-tools`
		- Just `cargo run wasm <RUBY_PROGRAM>`
	- [x] Document procedure for running, debugging output files

- [[Browser .wasm runner page]]
