- [[Lexer end-to-end test infrastructure]]
	4pt
	- [ ] Document workflow for producing lexer e2e tests
	- [x] Write an executable program for the lexer (later the compiler)
	- [x] Make program check for "output lexer information" flag
	- [ ] Format lexemes as Prism does
		- WONTFIX
		- It's hard cause they do locations weird...

# Completed

- [[Document how we'll use Ruby spec]]
	4pt
	- [x] Feasibility study on compiling and running the tests with our compiler
		Haha, no.
	- [x] If not, how can I manually convert spec tests to my tests?
		Stick it in a text file, run it through 
		`(our compiler -> wasm interpreter, mruby or cruby)`
		Compare the outputs
		- Blocked on recovering a readable output from Wasm interpreter.

- [[Document our value representation]]
	4pt
	- [x] Writeup
		[[docs/Value Representation]]

- [[Codegen for integers]]
	6pt
	- [x] Parse
	- [x] Lower to wasm

- [[Codegen for if_else, loops]]
	8pt
	- [x] Document strategy
	- [x] Parse if/else/elsif
		- Haven't considered ternary if yet.
			Not relevant until we use the non-statement expression position
		- Also consider "modifier `if` and `unless`" once we have non-statement expressions
	- [x] Lower to wasm if/else/elsif
	- [x] If/elsif doesn't need `then`. Fix.
	- [x] Testing for if/else/elsif
	- [x] Codegen for `unless`
	- [x] Parse `while/until` loops
	- [x] Lower to wasm `while/until` loops
	- [ ] Testing loops
	- We'll want to do `for` loops,  `case` exprs eventually, but it's harder.
	- Idk how `break, next, redo` statements should be codegen'd either
	- "Flip-flop" exprs are low-priority.

- [[Research parsing algorithms â€“ recursive descent & Pratt parsing (again...)]]
	6pt
	- [x] Recursive descent
	- [x] Pratt parsing
	- [[Pratt Parsing]]
