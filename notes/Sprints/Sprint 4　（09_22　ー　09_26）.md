- [ ]  Testing workflow
	- [x] Snapshot testing procedure
		[[Testing Strategy#Snapshot testing]]
	- [x] Run wasm binaries within the project
		- [x] Recover useable Ruby-values from Wasm output
			- [x] Add `Fixnum, ...` as real types in the codebase
		- [ ] Backfill end-to-end tests
			`input_file <-> wasm_output_value vs expected_value`
	- [x] Find a useable comparison format for lexer tests
		- sexprs would be nice. ∃ rust lib?
			https://docs.rs/serde-lexpr/0.1.3/serde_lexpr/
			https://github.com/rotty/lexpr-rs
		- [ ] Write up comparison tests for lexeme categories already in use
			- [ ] Numbers
			- [ ] if/else/elsif
			- [ ] loops
		- [x] Should this be "in-band", as `#[cfg(test)]` tests with strings?
			see: 「rust-analyzer」
			answer: With our setup, easy to do either.
	- [x] See what could be copied from ruby spec as-is
		see `lexer::tests::from_ruby_spec`
		- [x]  Fix code to conform to tests (within reason)

- [x] Rip out `::wasm` backend, replace with a library

- [ ] Research intermediate representation implementation

- [ ] core-lib research
	Current name for the "runtime support library"
	- I want to do it in Rust. Seems easiest.
	- [ ] How to build to Wasm?
	- [ ] Do I need or want `#[no_std]`?
		- [ ] Will that mess me up with some features?
	- [ ] How to interface with GC types?
		Maybe https://wasm-bindgen.github.io/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html
