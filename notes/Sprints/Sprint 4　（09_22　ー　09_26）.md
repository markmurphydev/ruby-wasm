- [ ]  Testing workflow
	- [ ] Snapshot testing procedure
	- [ ] Run wasm binaries within the project
		- [ ] Recover useable Ruby-values from Wasm output
			- [ ] Add `Fixnum, ...` as real types in the codebase
		- [ ] Backfill end-to-end tests
			`input_file <-> wasm_output_value vs expected_value`
	- [ ] Find a useable comparison format for lexer tests
		- sexprs would be nice. ∃ rust lib?
			https://docs.rs/serde_sexpr/latest/serde_sexpr/ かな
		- [ ] Write up comparison tests for lexemes already in use
		- Should this be "in-band", as `#[cfg(test)]` tests with strings?
			see: 「rust-analyzer」
	- [ ] See what could be copied from ruby spec as-is
		- [ ]  Fix code to conform to reasonably-doable tests

- [ ] Research intermediate representation implementation

- [ ] core-lib research
	Current name for the "runtime support library"
	- I want to do it in Rust. Seems easiest.
	- [ ] How to build to Wasm?
	- [ ] Do I need or want `#[no_std]`?
		- [ ] Will that mess me up with some features?
	- [ ] How to interface with GC types?
		Maybe https://wasm-bindgen.github.io/wasm-bindgen/introduction.html
