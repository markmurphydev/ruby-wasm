- [ ] (end-of-planning) Go over backlog items.

- [ ] Test that we can inject our corelib into Wat.
	- [x] Add test function `run_main_fn_body`
```rust
#[test]
pub fn object_class_get_name() {
	let ruby_top_level = "
(global.get $class-Object)
(global.get $STR-NEW)
(global.get $empty-args)
(call $call)
(global.get $STR-CLASS)
(globstartal.get $str-Class-name)
(global.get $empty-args)
(call $call)
(ref.cast (ref $class))
";
	let actual = run_core_with_ruby_top_level(text);
	
}
```
- [ ] Finish `$call` dispach
	- [ ] `$ALIST-PAIR-STR-METHOD` needs to have type `$method` for the second cell.

- [ ] We've reached the end of the road with Lisp symbolification.
	- [ ] Let's move it back into Rust
	- [ ]
